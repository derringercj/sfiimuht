# (game name)

## Overview

### Core Concept
The idea of (game name) is to create a game that can simulate the rush of and enjoyment of the sport of Fencing. Sports games are a huge genre in the industry and due to the niche nature of fencing, the sport is underrepresented in video game form. The sport has so much mental strategy and fluid, back and forth gameplay that makes it ripe for adaptation.

### Genre
In developing (game name), we want to replicate some of the most classic 2D fighting games such as Marvel vs Capcom or Street Fighter II, where the game gets its namesake. 

### Platforms
The target platform for (game name) will be PC. Starting first with developing for Windows, then subsequently porting it for Linux as well.

## Gameplay

### Modes
(game name) will implement three different primary modes, each one being a true recreation of the three different fencing weapons; Foil, Epee, and Saber. In these modes, two players will face off on a 2D stage in a bout of fencing. These matches will be played to 15 points.

#### Foil
In Foil, players will be able to move at a greater pace and with quicker animations, to match the faster speed of Foil compared to a weapon like Epee. The player will be able to advance, retreat, lunge, cross-step, parry, and beat just like in the actual sport. There will be a priority system designed into the game to replicate scoring in a real life Foil bout. The opponent's target error will be limited to their torso just as the real life rules of Foil dictate.

#### Epee
Much like in real life Epee, this mode will be a slower and heavier feeling style of play. Advances and retreats should feel more labored, lunges and parries should be slower and have more weight to their actions, and the overall pace of play will be the slowest of the three modes. The opponents hitbox will be represented by their entire body such as the real life rules of Epee. 

#### Saber
As you'd expect from Saber, this will be the quickest gameplay mode of all. Players will advance and retreat at lightning speed. Slashes and lunges will feel near instantaneous as well as lunges, replicating the blink-and-you'll miss it pace of a Saber touch. Like Foil, Saber will also implement a priority system to determine which player was the attacker and will be awarded the point in the case of two lights going off.

### Characters
The characters will be in standard fencing attire, with some options to pick characters with different color socks, masks, and whatnot. The characters themselves will not be very different.

### Stages
The primary stage will be a typical backdrop for a fencing match. The inspiration will either be like a world cup strip with a simple backdrop, or a local fencing club style environment.
